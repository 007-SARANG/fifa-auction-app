## 🔧 **How to Implement:**

### **Option 1: Replace Current Players Array**
Replace the `SAMPLE_PLAYERS` array in `App.jsx` with content from any generated file.

### **Option 2: Use Dynamic Import**
Modify the app to load different databases based on user preference.

### **Option 3: Server-Side Loading**
Store players in Firestore and load dynamically (for even larger databases).

## 📊 **Photo Quality:**

All generated players use:
- **Primary**: `cdn.futbin.com` (FIFA database images)
- **Fallback**: UI-Avatars for generated player images
- **High-quality mapping** for top 50 players

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Choose your preferred database size**
2. **Replace the current SAMPLE_PLAYERS array**
3. **Test the app with the new database**
4. **Optionally add more photo mappings for better images**

- **500 players (82+)**: Good balance
- **800 players (80+)**: More variety, slightly slower loading
- **1,721 players (78+)**: Maximum variety, may need optimization for large apps
