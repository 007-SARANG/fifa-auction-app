## 🔧 Configuration

### vitest.config.js
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './tests/setup.js',
    css: true,
  },
});
```

### tests/setup.js
- Configures testing environment
- Mocks Firebase modules
- Sets up cleanup after each test

## 📝 Adding New Tests

### Example Test Structure:
```javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('Feature Name', () => {
  describe('Specific Functionality', () => {
    it('should do something specific', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test data';
      
      // Act
      const result = processInput(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('expected output');
    });
  });
});
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Run Specific Test File:
```bash
npx vitest tests/playerDatabase.test.js
```

### Run Specific Test Suite:
```bash
npx vitest -t "Player Database"
```

### Run Tests in Debug Mode:
```bash
npx vitest --inspect-brk
```

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names that explain what is being tested
2. **Test Organization**: Group related tests using `describe` blocks
3. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
4. **Assertions**: Use clear and specific expectations
5. **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (Firebase, etc.)
